# edmABC Algorithm: Edge detection of mammography image using improved artificial bee colony algorithm, No: 836910

This repository contains the implementation of the **edmABC algorithm**, an improved Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization technique for edge detection in mammography images. The algorithm enhances edge accuracy and reduces noise, making mammogram analysis more effective for early breast cancer detection.

## **Features**
- Utilizes gradient values and statistical estimation for precise edge detection.
- Employs opposition-based learning and chaotic systems to ensure diverse exploration of solutions.
- Outperforms traditional edge detection techniques like Canny, Sobel, and Prewitt.
